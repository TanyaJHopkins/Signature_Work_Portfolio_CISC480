# Signature_Work_Portfolio_CISC480

From June of 2021 to March of 2022, I worked with several faculty/former faculty members of different departments at the University of St. Thomas (MN) to help launch, record, edit, and publish an interdisciplinary podcast known as “In the Belly of the Beast”. I worked to form a base of equipment for recording the podcast, operated said equipment while acting as an assistant showrunner during recording sessions, and then used my skills with audio production to edit, mix, and master the first 6 episodes of the podcast. 

During the run of the podcast, we initially focused on the disciplines of the faculty involved–as the expertise of the various hosts were highly relevant to the podcast–and later got to involve some external guests and figures in the community as well. The episodes I worked on were both interesting from a technical perspective, but were also enlightening from a sociopolitical perspective as well, and I’m immensely glad to have been involved in the project and exposed to such nuanced perspectives as the group had. 

Linked below is the third episode of the podcast as an example of the work I did with editing, mixing, and mastering.

I chose the third episode as an example to single out as it’s a good balance of interesting information, host involvement, and my mixing chain being well-tuned by that point.

                        <p>It’s time once again for our weekly bit of fun here at Midpoint: <em>By The Numbers</em>.</p>
<p>Following last week’s article about <a href="">the cost of different fast food items in America around the time of notable events in American history</a>, this week we’re talking about the sensational entertainment of the silver screen: Movies.</p>
<p>If you’ve been around the internet and looked for a movie once or twice, you’ve probably stumbled upon <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">the Internet Movie Database</a>–or
 IMDB as it’s almost solely referred to. Even if you haven’t, it’s just 
as possible you’ve seen their rating system while looking at movies or 
TV shows on Amazon (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603182852/http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=37602">acquired IMDB way back in 1998</a>). It may not be the only movie database out there, but it’s definitely the oldest and arguably the largest.</p>
<p>Given the breadth of IMDB’s data, it’s pretty cool to see that they offer <a href="https://datasets.imdbws.com/">regularly updated files</a>
 containing tons of information on various films and the people involved
 with them for nerds like us to obsess over.
We’ve selected some notable years in cinema history, made some graphs, 
had our morning coffee, and now it’s time to see if there’s any trends 
we can spot or lessons to be learned from looking at movies…<em><strong>By The Numbers</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="1939">1939</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/">The Wizard of Oz</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031381/">Gone with the Wind</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031679/">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032145/">Wurthering Heights</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031971/">Stagecoach</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>1939–also known as the “Golden Year” of Hollywood–encompases a lot of
 classic films and genre trends of the time despite having the fewest 
overall releases of the years we’ve chosen to look at:</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1939.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1939 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>We start off our travels through tables with Comedy in first place, 
followed by Romance in second place and Crime in third. At the bottom of
 the list, Animation holds the rear with only 2 films (<em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031971/">Gulliver’s Travels</a></em> &amp; <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032162/">The Golden Key</a></em>), while Sci-Fi and Fantasy tie for second-to-last.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1939.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1939"></p>
<p>In terms of user rating on IMDB, the Romance and War genres are neck 
and neck for the highest rated movies of 1939. War seems to have the 
largest range of ratings (though likely due to some outliers near the 
bottom), and Animation unsurprisingly has the smallest range of ratings 
given there were only 2 films to release in that category anyway.</p>
<h3 id="1959">1959</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053291/">Some Like It Hot</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/">Ben-Hur</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053285/">Sleeping Beauty</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053270/">Shadows</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053198/">The 400 Blows</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Where 1939 may have been Hollywood’s “Golden Year”, 1959 was the year that big budget cinema came into focus.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1959.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1959 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>Looking at the number of films per genre for 1959, we see that 
Animation has escaped the bottom spot for the second-to-last in exchange
 for Sport. As far as the top 3 genres, however, they seem to be the 
same as 1939 (Comedy in first, Romance in second, and Crime in third). 
It seems Film-Noir has left the building somehow as well.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1959.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1959"></p>
<p>When it comes to ratings for 1959, the History and Biography 
categories are duking it out for highest rated film, while Documentary 
contains the lowest rated film surveyed. Animation has a much larger 
range of ratings, but still takes the trophy on smallest range whereas 
Documentary has come around to the spot of largest range in this year.</p>
<h3 id="1967">1967</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061418/">Bonnie and Clyde</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/">The Graduate</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058461/">A Fistful of Dollars</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094484/">In the Heat of the Night</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061578/">The Dirty Dozen</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>1967 saw the waning of classic Hollywood and the pressure of younger 
audiences wanting something edgier being vented into the steam of 
spicier releases.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1967.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1967 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>Sport seems to remain at the bottom from last time, with Animation 
going up and Biography going down enough to create a tie for 
second-to-last. Our top 3 genres for 1967 are still the same as they 
were the last two years, but that’s not to say Crime isn’t trying it’s 
best with the gap between it and Romance closing to only 4 films.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1967.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1967"></p>
<h3 id="1975">1975</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/">One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/">Jaws</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073440/">Nashville</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>1975 saw the introduction of the summer blockbuster with <em>Jaws</em>, whilst also seing the release of one of the merely 3 films to ever win the ‘Big Five’ awards at the Oscars, <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1975.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1975 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>It would seem Sport is making a comfortable home for itself in last 
place now, while Animation is back to being firmly in second-to-last now
 that Biography has gone back up. On the other side of things, Crime has
 finally overtaken Romance to find itself in second place, meanwhile 
Comedy remains in first place and Romance sullies on down to fourth 
place after Action blasts its way to third.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1975.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1975"></p>
<p>Sliding over to Rating again, we see Documentary holding the highest 
rated film out of this year’s offerings, while Crime holds the lowest 
this time around. Crime also holds the largest range of ratings this 
time around despite harsh competition from Comedy, and while incredibly 
close between multiple categories, Western manages to take smallest 
range.</p>
<h3 id="1982">1982</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">Blade Runner</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/">The Thing</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/">Tron</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083866/">The Dark Crystal</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>1982 was a hallmark year for Fantasy and Sci-Fi, with multiple genre-defining releases in both genres.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1982.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1982 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>Sci-Fi and Fantasy both have moved quite a bit by this point compared
 to their starts in 1939, going from near the bottom to 11th and 9th 
places respectively. Speaking of shake-ups, Western has taken the rear 
spot away from Sport–now in second-to-last–despite much stronger 
showings in prior years. Comedy remains at the front of the pack, 
meanwhile Action has pushed up to second and pushed out Crime all the 
way to fourth, leaving room for Romance to re-enter the podium at third.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1982.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1982"></p>
<p>After a bit of time away, we’re back to Animation having the smallest
 range of ratings. At the same time, Comedy comes in with the largest 
range <em>and</em> the highest rated film this round. It’s close, but Horror appears to have the lowest score of the bunch this round.</p>
<h3 id="1994">1994</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/">Pulp Fiction</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/">The Lion King</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/">Leon: The Professional</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>1994 is a great example of a year where films were firing on all 
cylinders regardless of genre, creating a rapid fire of classics in a 
short amount of time.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1994.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1994 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>After a long period of floating around in the bottom third, Musical 
has at last taken the bottom spot away from Western, which lies only 3 
spots up in second-to-last place. Comedy has rested on its laurels in 
first place this whole time, and continues to do so while Action cements
 its place at second and Romance its spot at third.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1994.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1994"></p>
<p>Here we see Documentary with the widest range ever up to this point, 
followed in by Biography on the opposite side with smallest range. 
Documentary also holds the highest <em>and</em> lowest scores for this year in the same category.</p>
<h3 id="1999">1999</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/">Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/">The Blair Witch Project</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120601/">Being John Malkovich</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>What a more interesting year than 1999, with the turn of the 
millenium rapidly approaching and a number of influential films rushing 
out to audiences before the big Year 2000 hits.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar1999.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 1999 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>Well, it seems Western is getting decimated once again, as it’s back 
to the back of the line in releases for 1999 while Musicals has gotten 
back up but not by much in second-to-last place. Comedy seems like it’s 
never going to leave first, but Action has certainly left second and is 
pushed to third after Romance manages to slide up to second place.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/point1999.png" alt="Rating Distribution of Genres for Films Released in 1999"></p>
<p>For once we have a tie in largest range between Fantasy and 
Documentary, though Animation is no slouch either and has definitely 
come a long way since the early days. Music holds the trophy for 
shortest range for this year in a very narrow battle with History coming
 down to a 0.1 point difference. As far as highest rating goes, that’s 
still in the hands of Documentary, while Animation and Fantasy have 
taken joint custody of the lowest rating spot.</p>
<h3 id="2007">2007</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/">No Country for Old Men</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/">There Will Be Blood</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/">Hot Fuzz</a></em></li>

<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829482/">Superbad</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>What a great year for media in general, honestly. So many great 
albums within music, literally the best year for video games probably 
ever, and of course…some absolute hits in movies.</p>
<p><img src="By%20The%20Numbers%20Great%20Years%20In%20Cinema_files/bar2007.png" alt="Number of Movies Released in 2007 Sorted by Genre"></p>
<p>It seems like Western being in last and Musical being in 
second-to-last is something we’re getting quite used to at this point, 
but while the rear is unchanged the front of the pack is in absolute 
turmoil. Comedy hasn’t been unseated from first <em>yet</em>, but 
Documentary has literally tripled in the last 8 years prior to this 
point and rushed at breakneck pace to second, pushing Romance to third 
and Action completely out of the running–which doesn’t even take into 
account the 1 film lead Horror manages to sneak in above Action this 
year as well.</p>

<p>For the first time, we have a range spanning the whole graph that’s 
been plotted with Comedy (which of course hands it largest range, 
highest rating, and lowest rating for this year), meanwhile Western 
grabs smallest range.</p>
<h3 id="2016">2016</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/">Arrival</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/">La La Land</a></em></li>

<p>It really does seem like Western being in last and Musical being 
second to last is basically a foregone conclusion at this point, huh? 
What isn’t a foregone conclusion however is Comedy being at number one, 
as it’s at last been unseated by the massive boom in Documentary we’ve 
seen around 2007. As if that’s not enough upsets, Thriller has managed 
to shoot up into third place as well. It’s been accelerating a bit over 
the last couple years we’ve examined, but it’s just shy of doubled from 
2007 to now.</p>

<p>We’re still rolling with the graph-wide largest range, though in 
Documentary instead of Comedy this time (which may have something to do 
with the latter unseating the former as the reigning champion). Western 
manages to keep smallest range as well, and Thriller continues suddenly 
being notable with the lowest rating on the graph this year. On the 
highest rating side of things, both Biography and Comedy are tied.</p>
<h3 id="2021">2021</h3>
<p><em>Notable releases include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/">Dune</a></em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/">Spider-Man: No Way Home</a></em></li>

<p>2021 may not necessarily be considered a “major year in cinema”, but 
it can’t hurt to see how last year’s films stacked up against the 
heavy-hitters we’ve looked at thus far.</p>

<p>Other than History and Fantasy swapping places, it seems there’s no 
change whatsoever in the placement and trends of these categories aside 
from a general decrease across the board–likely due to the COVID-19 
pandemic that messed up film production real hard the year prior.</p>

<p>In our final round of examination, Action manages to come away with 
largest range, while Action, Documentary, Comedy, and Romance <em>all</em>
 come away tied for highest rating. Sport, meanwhile, manages smallest 
range just barely over Western, and Family takes the cake for lowest 
rating in 2021.</p>
<p>Finally–as we simply can’t resist–here’s every movie on IMDB sorted by Genre:</p>

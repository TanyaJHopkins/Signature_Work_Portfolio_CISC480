                <h5>Music</h5>
                <p>
                    I've been learning about and writing music since around my freshman year of high school, and through that effort I have made some great friends and even got a job working on a <a href="resume.html" target="_self" style="color: cyan;">podcast here at UST</a> with those same skills. I listen to music as obsessively as I involve myself in it--though over a much greater span of time.
                </p>
                <h5>Art / Design</h5>
                <img src="images/blender_small.png">
                <p>
                    I enjoy various forms of visual and conceptual art, as well as the study of said art. Lately, I've found myself building a collection of niche design books for the sake of archiving them (and staring at the pretty pictures, of course).
                    The background to this webpage serves a good example of my art, as I made it in Blender specifically for this project.

                <h5>Technology</h5>
                <p>
                    I have always loved technology, and will continue to love both it and the various devices I find myself surrounded with.

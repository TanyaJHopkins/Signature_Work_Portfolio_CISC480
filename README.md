# Signature_Work_Portfolio_CISC480

Within this github repo, there are four projects that span various different disciplines and methods. Between all of them are different methods of expression, whether technologically, mechanically, socially, verbally, or even visually.

The first project is an expression of self via technology, which I present partly as evidence of my experience in web development and design, and partly as an earlier resume that pertains to my experiences and projects outside of computer science. 

The second project is an expression of community via technology, as it was the first time I had been a part of a more formal development team. It also shows my expertise in unit testing and working with Java-based web applications and database interactions within that context.

The third project is an expression of communication via technology, as it is my attempt at a version of data communication in the mainstream that I often dislike, but attempted to impersonate anyway for the sake of empathy. It also shows my proficiency with RStudio / R / Tidyverse data science programming and further proficiency with web development and graphic design.

The fourth project is an expression of the world via technology, as it is a product of seeking community with those around the world delivered as a digital discussion of that which affects us as a society and how we can fight back against it which I am happy to have had the privilege of working on and supporting while I was able.

All of these expressions of technology show the use of it in various disciplines and sections of life, both to serve oneself and to serve the common good. Further details about each project can be found within their respective folders.

# Signature_Work_Portfolio_CISC480

The included files are an example of the work I did as part of my Capstone course in my final year of college.

I worked as part of a team of 6 to design and implement unit tests for the existing webapp Spock. We spent our development in Agile-esque cycles (as opposed to sprints) through which we suggested, assigned, explored, implemented, reviewed, and then merged tests and changes to those tests through the course of 4 cycles. 

It's far from the most glamorous thing, but I think it's a good skill to have proof of and good experience to be able to state. Unit testing can be very boring, and it certainly took me some time at the very start to get used to decoding and trawling through a large interconnected webapp such as this one, but I learned a lot in the process and am very glad I had the opportunity to do so.

The files included are split between the actual test file I've included as an example, and files that exist as part of the main Spock source code (not written by me) that I provide for the sake of context should they be necessary (I didn't want to paste in the entire webapp, as that would be both inefficient and confusing).
